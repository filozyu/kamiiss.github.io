# How to Read a Book
by M. J. Adler and C. Van Doren

## Inspectional Reading
### Two types of inspectional reading
Two types, but can be combined when experienced.
* Systematic Skimming or Pre-reading
	1. Title page and preface (by the author not editors)
	2. Table of contents
	3. Index (topics covered and reference, mainly for unknown books)
	4. Look at the sections crucial to the arguments (expository)
* Superficial Reading
	* Read through for the first time and leave out the things that one doesn’t understand (esp. difficult works).
This might not work for me since I do not consider taking long time to understand a book as much as possible in the first read through very frustrating, but we will see)

### Reading speeds
Important to have different speeds at reading different works,  different reading goals.

## Analytical Reading
### Four questions to ask a book to gain understanding
1. What is the book about as a whole?
2. What is being said in details, and how?
3. How would one (you) judge the book? (Is it true? In whole or part?)
4. What is the significance of the book? (seek for further enlightenment? take action suggested by practical books) - this rule does not apply to imaginative literature

### First stage: Finding what a book is about
1. *Classify the book according to the kind and subject matter.*
	* Importance of finding the message in the title
	* Expository works: conveying knowledge
		* Theoretical and practical works	: theoretical books teach something is the case (or knowledge itself); practical books teach how to do something (or the actions suggested).
		* Practical works: with judgement on doing something will incur good/bad practical results (of one’s goal or any general ends), somehow persuasive.
		* Theoretical works: (traditionally) history, science and philosophy
			* History: narration with comments, particular time and space
			* Science: general, special experience
			* Philosophy: general, normal experience
			* Mixture of science and philosophy: e.g. /Principles of Psychology/ by William James
		* Mixture of practical and theoretical, in this case identify which part is theoretical or practical. (e.g. /Ethics/ by Spinoza)

2. *State what the whole book is about with the utmost brevity.*
	* Unity (how it is one) and multiplicity (how it is many)
	* Fiction or History: unity is usually a single thread of plot
	* Others: the main set of arguments and the reasoning (this point is not given in the book)
	* Pay attention to author’s summary in title or preface or introduction
	* A summary is good as long as it is brief, accurate and comprehensive

3. *Enumerate the major parts in their order and relation, and outline these parts while outlining the whole.* (EXPOSITORY)
	* Treat parts as if they were subordinate wholes, each with a unity and a complexity of its own
	* The outline can thus be expanded indefinitely but in reality approximation should be done depending the quality of the book
	* This very note can serve as an example of outlining (not necessarily a good one though, see [[Outlining A Book]] for more personal views)
	* Many ways to outline (could refer to the content but do not rely on it entirely)
	* Knowing parts is a preliminary of knowing the unity
	* A good piece of writing should have unity, clarity (distinctness of outline) and coherence (orderly disposition of parts)

4. *Define the problem(s) the author has tried to solve.* (EXPOSITORY)
	* Find the main problems and subordinate problems, align them in an order (theoretical and practical questions)
	* Avoid intentional fallacy (esp. literary works)
	* Finding the intentions of the author helps to tell why the book has the unity it has and what end what end does the structure serve

### Second stage: Interpreting the contents of a book (EXPOSITORY)
1. *Come to terms with the author by interpreting the key words.*
	* Terms and words, neither direction could form a valid function
	* Key words: these are the words that cause the reader troubles
		* Words not ordinary (technical words, usually  every subject has a technical vocabulary, knowing which will help to understand, however not likely to be the case in philosophy)
	* Meaning of the words:  infer via context, in general, trail and error

2. *Grasp the author’s leading propositions by dealing with the most important sentences.*
	* Propositions are the answers to the questions raised in the book and (or) declarations of knowledge or opinion
	* Propositions are just personal opinions if they are not supported by reasons
	* Finding single arguments will meet with structural outlining in the middle (the former starts from the micro, the latter from the macro)
	* Distinguish various distinctions in a long sentence
	* Important sentences: likely to be the difficult sentences (compared to the rest) OR the sentences that contain the major affirmation and denials (principal propositions) the author is making and the reasons for doing so (express the judgement on which the author’s whole argument rests)
	* Key words sometimes lead to important sentences
	* Test your understanding by stating the proposition in your own words OR by pointing to some experience you have had or imaginative ones that are relevant to the proposition

3. *Know the author’s arguments, by finding them in, or constructing them out of, sequences of sentences.*
	* Many paragraphs do not express an argument
	* Look for summaries by the author
	* Spot missing propositions (without which the argument would be biased or invalid or intentionally hiding some important factors, part of this point is not given in the book)
	* Distinguish the inductive and deductive arguments (relying on evidence or on reasoning)
	* Find out what the assumption and axioms made by the author (including self-evident, indemonstrable but undeniable truths)

4. *Determine which of the author’s problem has been solved, and which has not; if not find out whether the author was aware of this failure.*
	* Refer to the problems identified in the last step of the first stage, then just do literally as above

### Third Stage: Criticising a book
* General Maxims of Intellectual Etiquette
	1. Do not begin criticism until you have understand the book (that is after finishing the first two stages listed above).
		* To say one does not understand is also a critical judgement, but only after one having tried one’s best (this depends on books, it is usually the reader’s fault in the case of good books)
		* Sometimes there are several other books by the same author that can serve as instruments or prerequisites to achieve understanding.
	2. Do not disagree disputatiously or contentiously.
		* Disagree reasonably, learning the truth is more important than winning the argument (Personal Opinion: that’s why I think debates I’ve had in schools are nonsense, you have to hold fast to your grounds no matter what happens)
		* One should be as prepared to agree as to disagree
	3. Distinguish criticism on knowledge and mere personal opinion by presenting sound reasoning for any critical judgement you make.
		* Do not disagree hopelessly, that is one should regard disagreements as capable of being resolved
		* The issue on knowledge can be resolved in that either the reader or the author can be instructed (usually the former)
		* Judge the book, not the author
		* Agree:  actively shares the author’s reasons; Disagree: give one’s own grounds for doing so
* Special Criteria for Points of Criticism
	1. Show wherein the author is uninformed.
	2. Show wherein the author is misinformed.
	3. Show wherein the author is illogical.
	4. Show wherein the author’s analysis or account is incomplete.
	* Note: the first 3 are criteria for disagreement, the last one is the case when one wishes to suspend judgement on the whole book.
