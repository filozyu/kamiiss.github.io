# Thoughts on HAMLET 3.1 Soliloquy


> Wether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer
> The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
> Or to take arms against a sea of troubles.
> And by opposing end them?

The above lines describe two different approaches, separating by the word “Or”. Based on the question the prince raised preceding these lines, the first approach would appear to be referring to the case of “to be”, while the second “not to be”. However from the proceeding lines we know that the case of “not to be” can be achieved by suicide ,“When he himself might his quietus make \ With a bare bodkin?” indicates that the opposite of suffering might be ending one’s life without fighting the so called “a sea of troubles”. This is confusing, since now we have two interpretation of “not to be”, one is to fight against the troubles and the other is to die so that the troubles can be avoided. Some might find that the second interpretation, to die, shows a sign of cowardice. The prince then explained that the difficulty of choice lies in the unknown nature of the death, as it seems that to die is more preferable if not considering this “rub”. What did the prince mean exactly as “cowards”? Could it be people who choose to suffer over to die? Or could it be people who choose to suffer over to fight? This again depends on how one interprets “no to be”. For me, fighting till death is a plausible interpretation, since it combines the idea of to die, to fight and even the resolution part further down the lines altogether. But I guess referring fighting to death as “not to be” is quite unfair, I would rather call it “to be”. Anyhow, evading the truth by taking one’s own life seems to me more cowardly than living with the pains.

What is the right interpretation? What does the prince mean?
